        question: 'How much edibles should I consume?',
        answerP1: `Everyone’s body has a different tolerance level to the compounds in cannabis, so it is important to consume a small amount of THC edibles, observe the effect, and then alter the dosage if necessary. The state of Colorado has defined a standard edible dose for recreational consumers to be 10mg of active THC. Remember you can always break up an edible into smaller pieces to find your desired dose.`

        question: 'What is the difference between smoking THC cannabis vs consuming THC cannabis edibles?',
        answerP1: `On average, a high from cannabis achieved through smoking or vaporizing lasts from one to two hours. A high stemming from the consumption of edibles tends to last four to eight hours. The quality of a product, the dosage being administered or consumed, and the potency of the product are factors to consider when comparing the intensity and longevity of smoking vs consuming cannabis. A factor that may take time to pinpoint is how your body metabolizes cannabis compounds.`,
        answerP2: `When smoking or vaporizing cannabis products, the body absorbs active cannabis compounds- like THC- from the bloodstream to the brain. In the brain, THC compounds attach to CB1 receptors where they begin to induce euphoric symptoms. Due to the body’s quick metabolization of cannabis compounds, effects from smoking typically have a shorter duration than cannabis edibles.`,
        answerP3: `Edible cannabis products are processed from the mouth via chewing to the stomach and the digestive tract.  In the digestive tract, active cannabis compounds will metabolize and be absorbed into the bloodstream where they will make their way to the brain. The longevity and intensity of edibles is attributed to the conversion of THC to 11-hydroxy-THC that occurs in the liver, resulting in a 4+ hour high.`

        question: 'What are THC topicals?',
        answerP1: `Topicals are infused with cannabis by using cannabis oil. Since topical application of cannabis does not breach the bloodstream or get consumers “high”, topicals are often used to treat the body’s endocannabinoid system.`,
        answerP2: `Topicals carried at Yuma Way dispensaries are available in THC or a variety of CBD:THC ratios.`

        question: 'What do I do if I have a negative experience after smoking or consuming cannabis?',
        answerP1: `Step 1. Remain calm`,
        answerP2: `Step 2. Drink plenty of water. You also have the option of chewing on black peppercorn to reduce some of the effects. If you find that you smoked or ate too much cannabis the best thing to do is to remain calm.`,
        answerP3: `Next, drink plenty of water to flush your system out. Change your scenery by taking a walk and getting some fresh air or relax in a warm bath to calm yourself.`
