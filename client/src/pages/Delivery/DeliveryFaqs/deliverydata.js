        id: 6,
        question: 'How long should I expect my order to arrive?',
        answer: 'It may take a few hours for your order to be delivered. This is mainly due to the limited number of companies who are currently licensed to deliver cannabis. Your driver may have to make multiple stops before arriving at your address.'
    },
    {
        id: 7,
        question: 'Can I place more than one order in a day?',
        answer: 'No. Just as with visiting a dispensary, state law allows for only one recreational marijuana purchase per day. As such, if you have come into the shop that day and made a purchase at the store, you will not be allowed a delivery order and vice versa.'
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: 'Where can I deliver my order to?',
        answer: 'The law requires that all cannabis deliveries go to a residential address, but they do not have to go to YOUR residential address. If you are ordering from a friend’s house that’s fine. But you are not allowed to place orders from a non-residential address such as an office or hotel. Currently, we can only deliver to Denver addresses. Input your address here to check whether we can deliver to your address.'

        id: 11,
        question: 'I am visiting from out of state. Can I place an order?',

    },
    {
        id: 12,
        question: 'What can I expect when my order arrives?',
        answer: 'When your order arrives, you will be asked to show your ID to verify your age and that you are the person who placed the order. It is required that the ID presented match the name on the order. If the person who placed the order is not present at the time of delivery, the driver will not be able to complete the delivery.'
